# matrix-population-models
A loose collection of theoretical and applied work on **matrix population models** (MPMs). This repository stems from a personal interest in MPMs, which help me in my professional activities at the [Research Institute for Nature and Forest](https://www.vlaanderen.be/inbo/en-gb/homepage/) (Belgium). MPMs play a particular role in our advisory work towards regional, national and European stakeholders on the management of **invasive species** and **game species**.
