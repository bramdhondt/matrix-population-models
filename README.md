# matrix-population-models
A loose collection of theoretical and applied work on matrix population models (MPMs). This repository stems from a personal interest in MPMs, which help me in my professional activities at the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (Belgium). MPMs play a particular role in our advisory work on the management of invasive species and game species.
